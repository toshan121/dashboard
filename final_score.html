**Overall Comments:**

* Overall, the scores are good, with most categories scoring above 70%.
* The only category that is below 50% is tasks completed, overdues and deficit. This is a concern and should be investigated further.
* The cash flow, burn, and runway score is also low, at 20%. This is also a concern and should be investigated further.

**Actions:**

* Investigate the reasons for the low score in tasks completed, overdues and deficit.
* Investigate the reasons for the low score in cash flow, burn, and runway.
* Implement measures to improve these scores.
