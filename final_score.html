  <h2>Overall</h2>

  <p>Your overall score is 75%. This is a good score, but there are some areas where you can improve.</p>

  <p>One area to focus on is your cash flow, burn, and runway. You are currently burning cash at a rate of $1,000 per week, and you have only $700 left in the bank. This means that you have an estimated runway of only 0.7 months.</p>

  <p>To improve your cash flow, you can increase revenue or reduce expenses. You can also consider raising additional capital.</p>
